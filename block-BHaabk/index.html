1. Create a simple page having a header, main content, and a footer.

2. Inside the header keep the brand name to the left and all the navigation to the right.

4. Inside the main content take an article section having two columns. In the first column put a heading and some introductory text of the article and in the second column take an image.

5. After the article section, take a gallery section, in which there will be two rows and in both the row there will be three columns. Each column must have a different image.

6. After the gallery section footer will come.

7. Use flexbox properties and values to create columns.

                    are all related to a single topic.
                    Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be
                    organized into paragraphs.
                    This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and
                    end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points. A
